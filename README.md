# Cloud9-on-RPi

Shell script created to automate the steps outlined here: https://medium.com/@chintanp/using-cloud9-3-0-ide-on-raspberry-pi-954cf2d6ab8e

Should create a working Cloud9 local installation accessible via a browser on RPi as well as remotely. 

Git doesn't work as expected as the development is limited to a directory.
